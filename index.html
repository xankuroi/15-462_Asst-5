<a id="proposal" class="anchor" href="#proposal" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Proposal</h3>

<p>For this assignment, I intend to implement cubic and quadratic Bezier curve rasterization in order to support font rendering. At the very least, the program should be able to render the font as though the font were monotype, with each character taking up a fixed width. However, I hope to be able to also provide some basic kerning and line wrap. </p>

<p>This project will most likely be built on top of the Mini-SVG Renderer code from Assignment 1. First, I will have to either implement a font loader or find one to link against. After that, implementation of Bezier curve rasterization, probably by converting explicit Bezier curves into an implicit representation, then evaluating said representation at each sample. Finally, investigation and implementation of character layout handling. </p>

<p>The goal will be to produce nice font rendering, such as what you're presumably seeing on your screen right now. In an ideal implementation, perhaps it would produce something like so:

<h3><a id="talk" class="anchor" href="#talk" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Project Details</h3>
<p>The project proved much more difficult than anticipated, and I was unable to finish in time. I wrote a parser for SVG path elements and implemented basic quadratic and cubic Bezier curve rendering. The admittedly inefficient implementation of the renderer resides in software_renderer.cpp. It simply uses the parametric representations of the curves and steps along them for 1000 timesteps. There is no handling for filling the curve at this stage. I didn't have time to test it vigorously, but the implementation seems to work for basic quadratic and cubic Bezier curves. Only a few types of instructions are supported by the renderer - M (moveto), C (cubic bezier), Q (quadratic bezier), L (lineto), and Z (close path). The renderer will simply skip doing any instructions that it does not recognize.</p>
<p>This extension to the Mini-SVG rasterizer was to use the font loader from FreeType. Though FreeType has its own rasterizer, the FreeType rasterizer would not have been used in this implementation if I had finished it.</p>

<h3><a id="build" class="anchor" href="#build" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Building and Running</h3>
<p>The project can be built in a similar fashion as Assignment 1. From the project's root directory (presumably asst5), run:</p>
<pre>
<code>cd build && rm -rf * && cmake .. && make</code>
</pre>
<p>There are two very basic Bezier curve SVG files located in svg/test. They are named basic-quad.svg and basic-cubic.svg. As their names would suggest, each one is a very basic Bezier curve of the type indicated by the title. They can be displayed using the renderer by running:</p>
<pre>
<code>./drawsvg ../src/test/</code>
</pre>
<p>from the build folder. They should look something like this: </p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/GBajXsy.png" alt="Cubic"></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/OrST4xe.png" alt="Quadratic"></p>
<p>In retrospect, I should have chosen curves that looked more different from each other.</p>


<h3><a id="learned" class="anchor" href="#learned" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I've Learned</h3>
<p>There was a lot of interesting material regarding font rendering, and despite hours and hours of pouring over the provided texts, I still haven't grasped all of the concept yet. I did, however, learn a great deal about the SVG file format and the TrueType format as well as about the FreeType library.</p>
<p>I also learned a lot about my own capabilities. I should have planned out my time better. I went in a bit blind in this regard, and had no idea it would take me so long to learn the concepts and how to use the library I linked. I thought that it would be best to link to an existing loader, but it took me a lot of time to deliberate between a few different options, a lot more than I anticipated. In the end, it took me too much time to just get through the preliminary material, so I did not have time to actually render any fonts.</p>
